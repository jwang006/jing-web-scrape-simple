or \"fitting the task to the man\".&#91;7&#93; it accounts for the user's capabilities and limitations in seeking to ensure that tasks, functions, information, and the environment suit that user.\nto assess the fit between a person and the used technology, human factors specialists or ergonomists consider the job (activity) being done and the demands on the user; the equipment used (its size, shape, and how appropriate it is for the task), and the information used (how it is presented, accessed, and changed). ergonomics draws on many disciplines in its study of humans and their environments, including anthropometry, biomechanics, mechanical engineering, industrial engineering, industrial design, information design, kinesiology, physiology, cognitive psychology, industrial and organizational psychology, and space psychology.\nthe term ergonomics (from the greek ἔργον, meaning \"work\", and νόμος, meaning \"natural law\") first entered the modern lexicon when polish scientist wojciech jastrzębowski used the word in his 1857 article rys ergonomji czyli nauki o pracy, opartej na prawdach poczerpniętych z nauki przyrody (the outline of ergonomics; i.e. science of work, based on the truths taken from the natural science).&#91;8&#93; the french scholar jean-gustave courcelle-seneuil, apparently without knowledge of jastrzębowski's article, used the word with a slightly different meaning in 1858. the introduction of the term to the english lexicon is widely attributed to british psychologist hywel murrell, at the 1949 meeting at the uk's admiralty, which led to the foundation of the ergonomics society. he used it to encompass the studies in which he had been engaged during and after world war ii.&#91;9&#93;the expression human factors is a predominantly north american&#91;10&#93; term which has been adopted to emphasize the application of the same methods to non-work-related situations. a \"human factor\" is a physical or cognitive property of an individual or social behavior specific to humans that may influence the functioning of technological systems. the terms \"human factors\" and \"ergonomics\" are essentially synonymous.&#91;2&#93;ergonomics comprise three main fields of research: physical, cognitive, and organizational ergonomics.\nthere are many specializations within these broad categories. specializations in the field of physical ergonomics may include visual ergonomics. specializations within the field of cognitive ergonomics may include usability, human–computer interaction, and user experience engineering.\nsome specializations may cut across these domains: environmental ergonomics is concerned with human interaction with the environment as characterized by climate, temperature, pressure, vibration, light.&#91;11&#93; the emerging field of human factors in highway safety uses human factor principles to understand the actions and capabilities of road users – car and truck drivers, pedestrians, cyclists, etc. – and use this knowledge to design roads and streets to reduce traffic collisions. driver error is listed as a contributing factor in 44% of fatal collisions in the united states, so a topic of particular interest is how road users gather and process information about the road and its environment, and how to assist them to make the appropriate decision.&#91;12&#93;according to the international ergonomics association, within the discipline of ergonomics there exist domains of specialization.\nphysical ergonomics is concerned with human anatomy, and some of the anthropometric, physiological and bio mechanical characteristics as they relate to physical activity.&#91;5&#93; physical ergonomic principles have been widely used in the design of both consumer and industrial products for optimizing performance and to preventing / treating work-related disorders by reducing the mechanisms behind mechanically induced acute and chronic musculoskeletal injuries / disorders.&#91;14&#93;  risk factors such as localized mechanical pressures, force and posture in a sedentary office environment lead to injuries attributed to an occupational environment.&#91;15&#93; physical ergonomics is important to those diagnosed with physiological ailments or disorders such as arthritis (both chronic and temporary) or carpal tunnel syndrome. pressure that is insignificant or imperceptible to those unaffected by these disorders may be very painful, or render a device unusable, for those who are. many ergonomically designed products are also used or recommended to treat or prevent such disorders, and to treat pressure-related chronic pain.&#91;16&#93;one of the most prevalent types of work-related injuries is musculoskeletal disorder. work-related musculoskeletal disorders (wrmds) result in persistent pain, loss of functional capacity and work disability, but their initial diagnosis is difficult because they are mainly based on complaints of pain and other symptoms.&#91;17&#93; every year, 1.8&#160;million u.s. workers experience wrmds and nearly 600,000 of the injuries are serious enough to cause workers to miss work.&#91;18&#93; certain jobs or work conditions cause a higher rate of worker complaints of undue strain, localized fatigue, discomfort, or pain that does not go away after overnight rest. these types of jobs are often those involving activities such as repetitive and forceful exertions; frequent, heavy, or overhead lifts; awkward work positions; or use of vibrating equipment.&#91;19&#93; the occupational safety and health administration (osha) has found substantial evidence that ergonomics programs can cut workers' compensation costs, increase productivity and decrease employee turnover.&#91;20&#93; mitigation solutions can include both short term and long-term solutions. short and long-term solutions involve awareness training, positioning of the body, furniture and equipment and ergonomic exercises. sit-stand stations and computer accessories that provide soft surfaces for resting the palm as well as split keyboards are recommended. additionally, resources within the hr department can be allocated to provide assessments to employees to ensure the above criteria are met.&#91;21&#93; therefore, it is important to gather data to identify jobs or work conditions that are most problematic, using sources such as injury and illness logs, medical records, and job analyses.&#91;19&#93;with the emergence of collaborative robots and smart systems in manufacturing environments, the artificial agents can be used to improve physical ergonomics of human co-workers. for example, during human–robot collaboration the robot can use biomechanical models of the human co-worker in order to adjust the working configuration and account for various ergonomic metrics, such as human posture, joint torques, arm manipulability and muscle fatigue.&#91;24&#93;&#91;25&#93; the ergonomic suitability of the shared workspace with respect to these metrics can also be displayed to the human with workspace maps through visual interfaces.&#91;26&#93;cognitive ergonomics is concerned with mental processes, such as perception, emotion, memory, reasoning, and motor response, as they affect interactions among humans and other elements of a system.&#91;5&#93;&#91;27&#93; (relevant topics include mental workload, decision-making, skilled performance, human reliability, work stress and training as these may relate to human–system and human–computer interaction design.) epidemiological studies show a correlation between the time one spends sedentary and their cognitive function such as lowered mood and depression.&#91;23&#93;organizational ergonomics is concerned with the optimization of socio-technical systems, including their organizational structures, policies, and processes.&#91;5&#93; relevant topics include human communication successes or failures in adaptation to other system elements,&#91;28&#93;&#91;29&#93; crew resource management, work design, work systems, design of working times, teamwork, participatory ergonomics, community ergonomics, cooperative work, new work programs, virtual organizations, remote work, and quality management. safety culture within an organization of engineers and technicians has been linked to engineering safety with cultural dimensions including power distance and ambiguity tolerance. low power distance has been shown to be more conducive to a safety culture. organizations with cultures of concealment or lack of empathy have been shown to have poor safety culture.\nsome have stated that human ergonomics began with australopithecus prometheus (also known as “little foot”), a primate who created handheld tools out of different types of stone, clearly distinguishing between tools based on their ability to perform designated tasks.&#91;30&#93; the foundations of the science of ergonomics appear to have been laid within the context of the culture of ancient greece. a good deal of evidence indicates that greek civilization in the 5th century bc used ergonomic principles in the design of their tools, jobs, and workplaces. one outstanding example of this can be found in the description hippocrates gave of how a surgeon's workplace should be designed and how the tools he uses should be arranged.&#91;31&#93; the archaeological record also shows that the early egyptian dynasties made tools and household equipment that illustrated ergonomic principles.\nmuch of this research transcended into other equipment with the aim of making the controls and displays easier for the operators to use. the entry of the terms \"human factors\" and \"ergonomics\" into the modern lexicon date from this period. it was observed that fully functional aircraft flown by the best-trained pilots, still crashed. in 1943 alphonse chapanis, a lieutenant in the u.s. army, showed that this so-called \"pilot error\" could be greatly reduced when more logical and differentiable controls replaced confusing designs in airplane cockpits. after the war, the army air force published 19 volumes summarizing what had been established from research during the war.&#91;33&#93;formed in 1946 in the uk, the oldest professional body for human factors specialists and ergonomists is the chartered institute of ergonomics and human factors, formally known as the institute of ergonomics and human factors and before that, the ergonomics society.\nthe human factors and ergonomics society (hfes) was founded in 1957. the society's mission is to promote the discovery and exchange of knowledge concerning the characteristics of human beings that are applicable to the design of systems and devices of all kinds.\nthe association of canadian ergonomists - l'association canadienne d'ergonomie (ace) was founded in 1968.&#91;38&#93; it was originally named the human factors association of canada (hfac), with ace (in french) added in 1984, and the consistent, bilingual title adopted in 1999.  according to it 2017 mission statement, ace unites and advances the knowledge and skills of ergonomics and human factors practitioners to optimise human and organisational well-being.&#91;39&#93;the international ergonomics association (iea) is a federation of ergonomics and human factors societies from around the world. the mission of the iea is to elaborate and advance ergonomics science and practice, and to improve the quality of life by expanding its scope of application and contribution to society. as of september 2008, the international ergonomics association has 46 federated societies and 2 affiliated societies.\nthe institute of occupational medicine (iom) was founded by the coal industry in 1969. from the outset the iom employed an ergonomics staff to apply ergonomics principles to the design of mining machinery and environments. to this day, the iom continues ergonomics activities, especially in the fields of musculoskeletal disorders; heat stress and the ergonomics of personal protective equipment (ppe). like many in occupational ergonomics, the demands and requirements of an ageing uk workforce are a growing concern and interest to iom ergonomists.\nthe international society of automotive engineers (sae) is a professional organization for mobility engineering professionals in the aerospace, automotive, and commercial vehicle industries. the society is a standards development organization for the engineering of powered vehicles of all kinds, including cars, trucks, boats, aircraft, and others. the society of automotive engineers has established a number of standards used in the automotive industry and elsewhere. it encourages the design of vehicles in accordance with established human factors principles. it is one of the most influential organizations with respect to ergonomics work in automotive design. this society regularly holds conferences which address topics spanning all aspects of human factors and ergonomics.&#91;41&#93;contemporary offices did not exist until the 1830s,&#91;42&#93; with wojciech jastrzębowsk's seminal book on msdergonomics following in 1857&#91;43&#93; and the first published study of posture appearing in 1955.&#91;44&#93;obstacles surrounding better ergonomic features to sedentary employees include cost, time, effort and for both companies and employees. the evidence above helps establish the importance of ergonomics in a sedentary workplace, yet missing information from this problem is enforcement and policy implementation. as a modernized workplace becomes more and more technology based more jobs are becoming primarily seated, therefore leading to a need to prevent chronic injuries and pain.  this is becoming easier with the amount of research around ergonomic tools saving money companies by limiting the number of days missed from work and workers comp cases.&#91;53&#93; the way to ensure that corporations prioritize these health outcomes for their employees is through policy and implementation.&#91;53&#93;until recently, methods used to evaluate human factors and ergonomics ranged from simple questionnaires to more complex and expensive usability labs.&#91;55&#93; some of the more common human factors methods are listed below:\n"
